# **NFKB-COVID19:** A genetic association study in R

The code here presented is a slightly cleaner adaptation of the script originally wrote to perform the analyses made in [Camblor et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2022.06.002), capable of reproducing its main results. In this work, we tried to investigate whether three polymorphisms in genes of the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway (genetic markers putatively related to changes in inflammation) were associated or not to the risk of death among COVID-19 ICU patients (refer to the aforementioned work for further details). This script is also relevant because it encompasses some of the common steps taken in genetic association studies.

## Content

The main file is `report.Rmd`, the script presented in R Markdown format. It aims at producing the HTML file found in the `gh-pages` branch, named `index.html`. Additionaly, `css/style.css` contains some custom CSS that can be reused to generate reports with the same styling.

To completely reproduce the results, the original data is required, but it is not provided here. As per the data availability statement, "*the data (...) are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request*".
